# Tab List (Player List) mod

## What in the world is this

A client-side mod for babric b1.7.3 that adds a simple Tab Player List to the game! The server needs to have some kind
of player list command (currently only /list) for this to work. If you know of other plugins that use different commands let me know.

This Readme will be updated at some point with some more info and images.
